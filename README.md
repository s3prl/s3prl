## What's New

* June 2021: Support extracting multiple hidden states from the SSL pretrained models
* April 2021: Support [**SUPERB:** **S**peech processing **U**niversal **PER**formance **B**enchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01051), submitted to Interspeech 2021
* Jan 2021: Readme updated with detailed instructions on how to use our latest version!
* Dec 2020: We are migrating to a newer version for a more general, flexible, and scalable code. See the introduction below for more information! The legacy verison can be accessed by checking out to the tag **v0.1.0**: `git checkout v0.1.0`.

## Introduction and Usages

This is an open source toolkit called **s3prl**, which stands for **S**elf-**S**upervised **S**peech **P**re-training and **R**epresentation **L**earning.
Self-supervised speech pre-trained models are called **upstream** in this toolkit, and are utilized in various **downstream** tasks.

The toolkit has **three major usages**:

### Pretrain
- Pretrain upstream models, including Mockingjay, Audio ALBERT and TERA.
- Document: [**pretrain/README.md**](./pretrain/README.md)

### Upstream
- Easily load most of the existing upstream models with pretrained weights in a unified I/O interface.
- Pretrained models are registered through **torch.hub**, which means you can use these models in your own project by one-line plug-and-play without depending on this toolkit's coding style.
- Document: [**upstream/README.md**](./upstream/README.md)

### Downstream
- Utilize upstream models in lots of downstream tasks
- Benchmark upstream models with [**SUPERB Benchmark**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01051)
- Document: [**downstream/README.md**](./downstream/README.md)

Below is an **intuitive illustration** on how this toolkit may help you:

Feel free to use or modify our toolkit in your research. Here is a [list of papers using our toolkit](#used-by). Any questsion, bug report or improvement suggestion is welcome through [opening up a new issue](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl/issues). 

If you find this toolkit helpful to your research, please do consider to cite [our papers](#citation), thanks!

## Installation

* **Python** >= 3.6
* Install **sox** on your OS
* Install generally used packages for *pretrain*, *upstream* and *downstream*:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl.git
cd s3prl/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../

git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq.git
cd fairseq/

# The version used by the repo maintainer currently.
# Please must not use the stable version 0.10.2 as it
# contains known bugs for wav2vec2 inference and ASR decoding
git checkout 8df9e3a4

pip install -e ./
cd ../
```

* Some upstream models require special dependencies. If you encounter error with a specific upstream model, you can look into the `README.md` under each `upsream` folder. Eg. `upstream/pase/README.md`

## Development pattern for contributors

1. [Create a personal fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the [main S3PRL repository](https://github.com/andi611/Self-Supervised-Speech-Pretraining-and-Representation-Learning) in GitHub.
2. Make your changes in a named branch different from `master`, e.g. you create a branch `new-awesome-feature`.
3. Contact us if you have any questions during development.
4. [Generate a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) through the Web interface of GitHub.
5. Please verify that your code is free of basic mistakes, we appreciate any contribution!
